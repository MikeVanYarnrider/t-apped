# t-apped

t-apped is an application that helps to bring people to free, fresh and clean water in Berlin.

As these kinds of drinking water wells are available in Berlin since 1985 (according to Wikipedia) and nobody knows about it, we saw it as our job to introduce these to the community.

The main focus groups are on the one hand water citizens and tourists and the other hands the service workers of "Berliner Wasserbetriebe" the water provider.

t-apped uses open data from the government of Berlin, seeded in a MongoDB database as there is no API available.

## Core Features

* map by mapbox
* user backend with interesting information about water usage in general
* admin backend for troubleshooting
* well details for availability, accessibility and commenting
* This application was created for demonstrative purposes and is not for sales use.

t-apped was created and developed by Pascal Hanke and Michael Garnreiter .
